# CROSS-score

## This is the code for the CROSS score project. This risk score was developed to identify patients with COVID-19 at risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission within seven days of emergency room presentation. The model can help in ER patient triage and in allocating ICU resources, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
